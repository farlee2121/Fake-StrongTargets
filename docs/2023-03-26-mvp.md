## Motivation

I'm questioning if I should release a nuget package for this project.
I want to enumerate tasks and considerations before releasing an MVP.

I probably answered some of these questions before, but unfortunately did not keep my Zen10 notes.


## TODO

- [ ] Consider the namespacing
  - [ ] how likely is it I'd expand the strong typing to other namespaces?
- [ ] Consider potential existing features (notably `?` and `?<-` operators that allow tokens instead of strings) 
- [ ] consider repository naming
